# About Me
I am a Second Year Graduate student in the Computer Science department at Rutgers University. Currently, I am working on my research thesis which lies at the intersection of human cognition and artificial intelligence, wherein I am building predictive models around human memory and decision-making.

Recently I worked with NVIDIA as a Summer Intern where I got a chance to tackle some interesting problems in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Pattern Recognition. Before starting my Master's journey, I had a professional work experience of 3 years as a Data Scientist in the Fin-Tech space.

At Simpl (Market leading Pay-Later platform in India), I was a member of the Credit Underwriting and AntiFraud Team where I designed statistical experiments and developed Machine Learning models while taking end-to-end ownership of the ML lifecycle. Prior to this, I built Risk Analytics frameworks at Flexiloans (a Digital Lending platform for SMEs in India). 

My tech stack majorly includes Python, R, SQL, AWS, and GCP along with other DS and ML tools.
